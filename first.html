    <h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello</h1>
    <br> It's me
    I've thought about us for a long, long time<br>
    I think too much but something's wrong<br>
    Something's here that doesn't last too long.<br>
    Maybe I shouldn't think of you as mine.<br>
    <em>Seeing you,seeing anyone as much as I do you,<br>
        <strong> take for granted that you're always there,<br>
            I take for granted that you just don't care.<br></strong>
        Sometimes I can't help seeing all the way through,baby.<br></em>
    <br>
    It's important to me<br>
    That you know you are free<br>
    Cause I never want to make you change for me, babe (don't change, don't change)<br>
    No, I wouldn't change you, change you for the world (don't change, don't change)<br>
    No, don't change, girl (don't change, don't change)<br>
    Stay as sweet as you are (don't change, don't change)<br>
    But one thing I want you to do is,<br>
    <br>
    Think of me, think of me, yeah<br>
    You know I'd be with you if I could,<br>
    Come around and see you once in a while,<br>
    If you ever need a reason to smile,<br>
    I'd spend the night if you think I should.<br>
    <br>
    <u>It's important to me<br>
        That you know you are free<br>
        Cause I never want to make you change for me<br></u>
    <br>
    And I'll come around and see you once in a while,<br>
    If you ever need a reason to smile,<br>
    I'd spend the night if you think I should.<br>
    <br>
